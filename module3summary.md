## Basic Concepts for Embedded

### 1. Sensors and Actuators
    
The main difference between sensor and actuator is that a sensor is used to monitor the changes in the environment while an actuator is used to control the environmental or physical changes.

#### What is a sensor?
A sensor is a device that can detect the changes in a physical environment. It can convert physical parameters such as temperature, heat, motion, humidity, pressure, etc. into electrical signals. We can transform this signal into a human readable display and send them through a network for further processing. There are mainly two types of sensors as active sensors and passive sensors. Active sensors require power supply while passive sensors do not require a power supply.
#### What is an actuator?
An actuator is a device that converts a control signal into some kind of movement. It obtains a control signal in the form of electric voltage, current, hydraulic fluid, pneumatic or hydraulic pressure. The actuator converts the received control signal into mechanical motion.
