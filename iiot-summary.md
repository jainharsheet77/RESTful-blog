An IoT Gateway is a solution for enabling IoT communication, usually device -to-device communications or device-to-cloud communications. The gateway is typically a hardware device housing application software that performs essential tasks. At its most basic level, the gateway facilitates the connections between different data sources and destinations.

A simple way to conceive of an IoT Gateway is to compare it to your home or office network router or gateway. Such a gateway facilitates communication between your devices, maintains security and provides an admin interface where you can perform basic functions. An IoT Gateway does this and much more.

In an increasingly complex IoT reality with more large scale IoT projects, loads of IoT communication protocols, industrial and IoT standards and many types of sensors and sensor data sitting a bit everywhere (all depending on the scope on the project) a device was and is needed to:

* bridge it all and enable those various things and sensors and data to ‘talk’ with each other (despite speaking a different language) and
* making some sense of it all before sending all this data somewhere else where it really – ideally – leads to real sense, actionable insights 
   and actions in whatever shape.

PLC ,Sensors, various devices and objects collect huge amounts of data.The collected data is sent to a central Cloud-based service where it is aggregated with other data and then shared with end users in a helpful way with the help of IIOT Gateways.IIOT Gateways of many companies such as Moxa, Adlink, Huawei, Cisco, Anybus etc are available.

>#### 1. Digital/Connected factory:
>IoT enabled machinery can transmit operational information to the partners like original equipment manufacturers and to field engineers.
>This will enable operation managers and factory heads to remotely manage the factory units and take advantage of process automation and 
>optimization. Along with this, a digitally connected unit will establish a better line of commands and help identify key result areas (KRAs) 
>for managers.

>#### 2. Facility management:
>The use of IoT sensors in manufacturing equipment enables condition-based maintenance alerts. There are many critical machine tools that are 
>designed to function within certain temperature and vibration ranges. IoT Sensors can actively monitor machines and send an alert when the 
>equipment deviates from its prescribed parameters. By ensuring the prescribed working environment for machinery, manufacturers can conserve 
>energy, reduce costs, eliminate machine downtime and increase operational efficiency.

>#### 3. Production flow monitoring:
>IoT in manufacturing can enable the monitoring of production lines starting from the refining process down to the packaging of final products. 
>This complete monitoring of the process in (near) real-time provides scope to recommend adjustments in operations for better management of 
>operational cost. Moreover, the close monitoring highlights lags in production thus eliminating wastes and unnecessary work in progress 
>inventory.

>#### 4. Inventory management:
>IoT applications permit the monitoring of events across a supply chain. Using these systems, the inventory is tracked and traced globally on a 
>line-item level and the users are notified of any significant deviations from the plans. This provides cross-channel visibility into 
>inventories and managers are provided with realistic estimates of the available material, work in progress and estimated the arrival time of 
>new materials. Ultimately this optimizes supply and reduces shared costs in the value chain.

Manufacturers and industrialists in every sector have a significant opportunity at hand where they can not only monitor but also automate many of complex process involved in manufacturing. While there have been systems which can track progress in the plant but the industrial IoT (IIoT) technology provides far more intricate details to the managers.

>According to a research by Business Insider, global manufacturers will invest $70 billion in IoT solutions in 2020. That's up from $29 billion >from 2015.

#### Why are IoT gateways used?

A complete IoT application might involve many different kinds of sensors and devices. Using Smart Agriculture again, you might want sensors for temperature, moisture, and sunlight and devices such as automated irrigation and fertilizer systems.

All of the different sensors and devices can use varying network connectivity types (basically, the rules and format for the information being transmitted). Connectivity types include LPWAN, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee, among many others.

Gateways can communicate with sensors/devices over varying connectivity types and then translate that data into a standard protocol such as MQTT to be sent to the cloud.


#### Few IIoT Gateway devices-

##### [MGate 5118 Series](https://www.moxa.com/getmedia/7914e681-d723-40b8-8cc7-0701e4588458/moxa-mgate-5118-series-datasheet-v1.0.pdf)
![](https://www.moxa.com/getattachment/Products/INDUSTRIAL-EDGE-CONNECTIVITY/Protocol-Gateways/Modbus-TCP-Gateways/MGate-5118-Series/moxa-mgate-5118-series-image-2-(2).jpg)
The MGate 5118 industrial protocol gateways support the SAE J1939 protocol, which is based on CAN bus (Controller Area Network). SAE J1939 is used to implement communication and diagnostics among vehicle components, diesel engine generators, and compression engines, and is suitable for the heavy-duty truck industry and backup power systems. It is now common to use an engine control unit (ECU) to control these kinds of devices, and more and more applications are using PLCs for process automation to monitor the status of J1939 devices connected behind the ECU.

The MGate 5118 gateways support the conversion of J1939 data to Modbus RTU/ASCII/TCP, EtherNet/IP, or PROFINET protocols to support most PLC applications. Devices that support the J1939 protocol can be monitored and controlled by PLCs and SCADA systems that use the Modbus RTU/ASCII/TCP, EtherNet/IP, and PROFINET protocols. With the MGate 5118, you can use the same gateway in a variety of PLC environments.

#### Power Quality Loggers/Analyser

A power quality anayzer is used to measure electric power signals to determine the load's ability to function properly with that electric power. Without the correct electric power, electrical equipment may fail prematurely or malfunction. There are many different different factors that contribute to poor quality power.

Power quality analyzers, such as any Fluke Series meter, track several electrical parameters, which include AC voltage, AC current power, and frequency. Electrical data parameters include demand and peak demand. Electrical demand is the actual amount of power that the monitored system uses. Peak electrical demand is the maximum amount of electric power that can be used. Typically, power parameters are measured in watts (W), volt amperes (VA), and volt ampere reactives (VAR). Watts are units of electrical power that indicate the rate of energy produced or consumed by an electrical device. Volt amperes equal the current flowing in a circuit multiplied by the voltage of that circuit. Volt ampere reactives identify the reactive component of volt amperes.
