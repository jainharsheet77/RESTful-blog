An IoT Gateway is a solution for enabling IoT communication, usually device -to-device communications or device-to-cloud communications. The gateway is typically a hardware device housing application software that performs essential tasks. At its most basic level, the gateway facilitates the connections between different data sources and destinations.

A simple way to conceive of an IoT Gateway is to compare it to your home or office network router or gateway. Such a gateway facilitates communication between your devices, maintains security and provides an admin interface where you can perform basic functions. An IoT Gateway does this and much more.
PLC ,Sensors, various devices and objects collect huge amounts of data.The collected data is sent to a central Cloud-based service where it is aggregated with other data and then shared with end users in a helpful way with the help of IIOT Gateways.IIOT Gateways of many companies such as Moxa, Adlink, Huawei, Cisco, Anybus etc are available.

>#### 1. Digital/Connected factory:
>IoT enabled machinery can transmit operational information to the partners like original equipment manufacturers and to field engineers.
>This will enable operation managers and factory heads to remotely manage the factory units and take advantage of process automation and 
>optimization. Along with this, a digitally connected unit will establish a better line of commands and help identify key result areas (KRAs) 
>for managers.

>#### 2. Facility management:
>The use of IoT sensors in manufacturing equipment enables condition-based maintenance alerts. There are many critical machine tools that are 
>designed to function within certain temperature and vibration ranges. IoT Sensors can actively monitor machines and send an alert when the 
>equipment deviates from its prescribed parameters. By ensuring the prescribed working environment for machinery, manufacturers can conserve 
>energy, reduce costs, eliminate machine downtime and increase operational efficiency.

>#### 3. Production flow monitoring:
>IoT in manufacturing can enable the monitoring of production lines starting from the refining process down to the packaging of final products. 
>This complete monitoring of the process in (near) real-time provides scope to recommend adjustments in operations for better management of 
>operational cost. Moreover, the close monitoring highlights lags in production thus eliminating wastes and unnecessary work in progress 
>inventory.

Manufacturers and industrialists in every sector have a significant opportunity at hand where they can not only monitor but also automate many of complex process involved in manufacturing. While there have been systems which can track progress in the plant but the industrial IoT (IIoT) technology provides far more intricate details to the managers.

>According to a research by Business Insider, global manufacturers will invest $70 billion in IoT solutions in 2020. That's up from $29 billion >from 2015.
